The Upshot came to this conclusion by looking at six data points for each county in the United States: 
    - education (percentage of residents with at least a bachelor’s degree), 
    - median household income, 
    - unemployment rate, 
    - disability rate, 
    - life expectancy and obesity. 
We then averaged each county’s relative rank in these categories to create an overall ranking.
